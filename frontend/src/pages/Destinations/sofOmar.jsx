          <hr />
          <p>
            Sof Omar Cave is one of Ethiopia's most spectacular natural wonders and the longest cave system in the country. 
            Located in the Bale Zone of the Oromia Region, this immense network of limestone caves was carved by the Web River 
            over millions of years. The caves stretch for approximately 15.1 kilometers, with the river flowing through 
            about 1.5 kilometers of the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The caves are not only a geological marvel but also hold great cultural and religious significance as an 
            important Islamic pilgrimage site. Named after Sheikh Sof Omar who took refuge here in the 12th century, 
            the caves feature stunning rock formations, vast chambers, and the constantly flowing Web River that adds 
            to the mystical atmosphere.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The Sof Omar caves have been known to local people for centuries, serving as both a natural fortress and 
            a spiritual site. The caves are named after Sheikh Sof Omar, a Muslim holy man who used the caves as a 
            refuge during his religious missions in the 12th century. Since then, the caves have become an important 
            Islamic pilgrimage site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientifically, the caves were first documented by European explorers in the late 19th century. The first 
            complete mapping was done in the 1970s by a British expedition. Today, Sof Omar is recognized as one of 
            Africa's most significant cave systems and an important tourist destination in Ethiopia.
