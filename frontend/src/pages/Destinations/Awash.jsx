          <h2>About Awash National Park</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Established in 1966, Awash National Park is Ethiopia's first
            national park, located in the Rift Valley approximately 225km east
            of Addis Ababa. Covering 756 square kilometers, it protects a
            diverse landscape of acacia woodlands, savanna grasslands, and
            volcanic formations. The park is bisected by the Awash River which
            cascades over volcanic rocks to create stunning waterfalls.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Ethiopia's most accessible national park, Awash offers visitors a
            chance to experience East African wildlife without traveling far
            from the capital. The park was created to protect its diverse
            ecosystems and the wildlife that depends on them, particularly the
            endangered Beisa oryx.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The area that is now Awash National Park has been inhabited for
            millennia, with archaeological sites revealing evidence of early
            human settlement. In the 1960s, the Ethiopian government recognized
            the need to protect the unique ecosystems along the Awash River and
            designated it as Ethiopia's first national park.
          </p>
          <p>
            The park gained international significance when the famous hominid
            fossil "Lucy" (Australopithecus afarensis) was discovered just
            outside its boundaries in 1974. Today, the park faces challenges
            from human encroachment and climate change, but remains an important
            conservation area.

              Awash National Park is located in the Afar Region of Ethiopia,
              approximately 225km east of Addis Ababa. The park spans both the
              Oromia and Afar regional states along the Addis Ababa-Djibouti
              highway. It covers an area of 756 square kilometers at the
              southern end of the Afar Depression, where the Awash River flows
              through dramatic gorges and waterfalls before disappearing into
              the desert.
