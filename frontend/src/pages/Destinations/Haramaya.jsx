            Lake Haramaya is a freshwater lake located in the East Hararghe Zone of the Oromia Region, 
            about 15 kilometers from Harar and 40 kilometers from Dire Dawa. The lake covers approximately

          <p>
            The lake holds significant cultural importance for the surrounding communities and is closely 
            associated with Haramaya University, one of Ethiopia's leading agricultural institutions located

          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Lake Haramaya has been an important water source for centuries, supporting agricultural 
            activities in the fertile Haramaya valley. The area was traditionally inhabited by the Oromo 
            people who practiced farming around the lake's shores.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 20th century, the lake became associated with the establishment of Alemaya College of 
            Agriculture (now Haramaya University) in 1954. The lake has faced environmental challenges in 
            recent decades, including periods of drying, but remains an important ecological and cultural site.
