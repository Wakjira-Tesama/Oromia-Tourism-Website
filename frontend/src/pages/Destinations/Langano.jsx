          <h2>About Lake Langano</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Lake Langano is a beautiful freshwater lake located in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia, 
            about 200 kilometers south of Addis Ababa. With its reddish-brown waters and scenic 
            surroundings, it's one of Ethiopia's most popular recreational destinations. The lake 
            covers approximately 230 square kilometers and is situated at an elevation of 1,585 meters 
            above sea level.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes Langano particularly special is that it's free from bilharzia (schistosomiasis), 
            making it safe for swimming and water sports. The lake is surrounded by acacia woodlands 
            and offers stunning views of the nearby mountains, creating a perfect setting for relaxation 
            and adventure.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Lake Langano was formed through tectonic activity in the East African Rift Valley system. 
            The area has been inhabited by the Oromo people for centuries, who traditionally used the 
            lake for fishing and as a water source for their livestock.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 20th century, the lake gained popularity as a recreational destination, especially 
            after the construction of several resorts along its shores. Today, it serves as an important 
            ecotourism site and a weekend getaway for residents of Addis Ababa and other urban centers.

          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Lake Langano is easily accessible from Addis Ababa via the well-maintained Addis Ababa-Shashamane 
            highway. The drive takes approximately 3-4 hours by car. Public minibuses regularly travel from 
            Addis Ababa to the lake area, with drop-offs at various resorts. The nearest major town is Shashamane, 
            about 25 kilometers from the lake's northern shore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many visitors combine a trip to Lake Langano with visits to nearby attractions like Abijatta-Shalla 
            National Park or the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary, both within an hour's drive from the lake.
