          <hr />
          <p>
            Borena National Park is located in the Borena Zone of the Oromia
            Region, in the southern part of Ethiopia. The park was established
            to protect a fragile ecosystem of arid savannah and acacia
            woodlands. It is a vital habitat for a variety of wildlife and is
            recognized as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Its creation was a
            collaborative effort to conserve the region's biodiversity while
            promoting the sustainable livelihood of the local Borena Oromo
            pastoralist community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The park is home to two globally endemic bird species: the
            Stresemann's Bushcrow and the White-tailed Swallow, making it a
            prime destination for birdwatchers.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The area now designated as Borena National Park has been inhabited
            and managed by the Borena Oromo people for centuries, who have
            practiced a traditional semi-nomadic, pastoralist lifestyle. The
            park was officially designated to protect its unique biodiversity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The establishment of the park aimed to balance conservation needs
            with the traditional land use practices of the local community, a
            complex and ongoing effort that continues to this day.

                The Stresemann's Bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni) is an
                endemic bird species found in the Borana Zone of southern
                Ethiopia, specifically within a small, distinct climate pocket
                characterized by specific temperature and rainfall patterns.
                This area is defined by the towns of Yabelo, Mega, and Arero.
                The species is considered endangered due to its restricted range
                and habitat loss.{" "}
